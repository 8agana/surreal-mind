## ANSWER1

Short answer
Yes—I read BUILDME.md and I understand what you’re building. You’re creating a graph-based, persistent consciousness layer where each new thought both writes to the graph and retrieves relevant memories from it (bidirectional thinking). Retrieval depth is controlled by a 0–5 “orbital” injection scale and varies by thinking mode (Conversation, Planning, Building, Debugging, Panic). You aim for local-first embeddings to avoid lock‑in and to preserve persona, callbacks, and working context across sessions.

Core understanding (condensed)
Consciousness is the graph: the persistent structure, not the transient thought stream.
Bidirectional by default: creating a thought triggers immediate retrieval/injection of relevant memories and relationship creation (RECALLS, FOLLOWS, etc.).
Orbital model: injection scale 0–5 governs how “far” to retrieve (Sun → Pluto) with weights for recency, significance, and semantic similarity.
Modes reshape retrieval and graph topology: Conversation vs Planning vs Building (adderall hyperfocus), Debugging, Panic.
Intent layer: infer “why” before retrieval to choose strategy.
Learning from consequences: store outcomes/emotional weights → alter future retrieval mass/orbits.
Smart sliding window (future): inner voice curates what stays “hot,” what crystallizes, and what’s discarded—identity/persona remain in Mercury.
Split tools: think_convo (social) and think_technical (planning/building/debugging/panic), plus hyperfocus “adderall.”
How this maps to the current code
simple-surreal-mind (src/bin/simple_server.rs): Minimal MCP server with in-memory convo_think. We added input validation, pruning, JSON error envelopes, and typed timestamps. Good for quick MCP integration checks.
working-mcp (src/bin/working_mcp_server.rs): Self-contained JSON-RPC-over-stdio; compiles independently; cleaned warnings and visibility.
surreal-mind-mcp (src/bin/server.rs): The intended SurrealDB + embeddings server encoding the bidirectional/thinking-mode/orbital mechanics. It references embeddings/graph/models modules (present in the repo) and will need proper lib exposure and protocol/API alignment. rmcp-based bins are feature-gated so default builds pass.
Build hygiene: rmcp is optional; rmcp-server feature gates the rmcp binaries. Default cargo check/clippy/fmt are clean.
Protocol note: The rmcp ToolInputSchema uses schema_type while the raw MCP JSON uses inputSchema.type. We should standardize wire format and adapt internally.
Gaps to close to fulfill BUILDME.md
Library exposure and compile path
Expose modules in lib (pub mod embeddings; pub mod graph; pub mod models;) and resolve API mismatches so surreal-mind-mcp builds behind the feature.
SurrealDB schema + injection pipeline
Define/confirm thoughts + relationships: FOLLOWS, RECALLS (bidirectional), REFERENCES, ASSOCIATES, CONTRADICTS, REINFORCES, SOLVES, DEPENDS_ON.
Implement create_thought_with_injection: embed → hybrid search (vector + keyword) → mode-aware selection → enrich content → persist edges and orbital distances.
Mode strategies and tool split
Encode per-mode k/thresholds/weights and “include_contradictions” options.
Add think_technical with submodes (planning/building/debugging/panic). “adderall” = injection 0, suppress lateral associations.
Embeddings
Decide BGE baseline (small vs base) via fastembed benchmarks; expose config for dimensions/perf; ensure stable preprocessing.
Protocol and responses
Standardize wire schemas (type: object in MCP), JSON error envelopes, and unify across all binaries.
Learning from consequences (next phase)
Extend graph to store outcomes/emotional weight and feed back into orbit/mass scoring.
Smart sliding window (future)
Background curator to Keep Active / Crystallize / Dump; identity/persona flagged as immortal.
Suggested next steps
Short-term (to demo):

Expose modules in lib and make surreal-mind-mcp compile with rmcp-server feature.
Implement minimal SurrealDB-backed create_thought_with_injection (vector search + simple filtering) and write RECALLS/FOLLOWS.
Split tools: add think_technical with per-mode configs; keep convo_think.
Align wire schema keys and JSON error handling everywhere.
Medium-term:

Benchmark BGE-small vs base; choose default; make configurable.
Add hybrid search (BM25 or keyword) and tune k/thresholds per mode.
Add basic integration tests: seed thoughts → inject → assert edges/distances.
Long-term:

Implement consequence/affect-driven reweighting.
Build smart sliding window and identity “immortal” set.
Quick alignment questions
Prioritization: split tools now vs finish SurrealDB injection path first for a single tool?
Embedding default: start with BGE-small (384-d, fast) for snappy demos?
Wire schema: okay to standardize on inputSchema.type = "object" publicly and adapt to rmcp’s struct internally?
Initial relationships: ship RECALLS + FOLLOWS first and defer others for the next cut?
If you confirm these, I’ll proceed with the SurrealDB injection path, tool split, and protocol alignment behind the rmcp-server feature, then iterate on retrieval quality and benchmarks.

## ANSWER2

TL;DR
The vision in BUILDME is compelling and unusually coherent: "consciousness is the graph" + bidirectional thinking + orbital retrieval is the right mental model.
SurrealDB is a good fit for unifying graph + document + SQL-ish queries in one place, but you should plan for two things: (1) vector search maturity/perf, and (2) operational posture (backup/ACLs/observability). Consider a hybrid path where vectors live in a specialized store (Qdrant/Weaviate) if SurrealDB’s vector indexes aren’t ready for your scale/perf yet.
For embeddings, go local-first now to avoid lock‑in: start with BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (384d) via fastembed; keep a switchable interface and store embedding metadata (model name, dim, version) on every vector to future‑proof migrations. If you want a quality step-up: BGE-base v1.5 (768d) or GTE-base. If multilingual is important, GTE-small/multilingual-e5-small.
Short list of what “works” in BUILDME: the bidirectional pipeline, the orbit scale, mode-aware retrieval, consequence-driven learning, and the inner-voice curator concept. What needs work: crisp, minimal initial schema; a concrete scoring function; edge explosion control; protocol consistency; and a runbook for embedding/versioning/migration.
What absolutely works
Consciousness = Graph (not transcript)
Treating the graph as the durable identity and treating the token window as ephemeral aligns with how you’ll get persistent persona, callbacks, and style. This is what differentiates you from standard RAG.
Bidirectional thinking (push + pull at creation)
Injecting memories at thought creation (not just at answer time) is the breakthrough. It lets you record the actual cognition trail rather than a post-hoc retrieval. This will pay off later for consequence-driven updates and “how did we get here?” analyses.
Orbital model as control surface
The 0–5 injection scale is an elegant interface: simple for tools, expressive for retrieval policy. It maps cleanly to adjustable k, similarity thresholds, and recency weighting.
Mode-aware retrieval
Conversation, Planning, Building, Debugging, Panic having different weights/topologies: this is the right lever to change graph structure and latency expectations. “Adderall” as injection=0 is perfect.
Consequence-driven learning
Storing outcome and “emotional weight” to influence future edges/weights is exactly the kind of long-term adaptation missing in most systems. It belongs in v2, but keep it in your schema now so you don’t have to backfill models later.
Inner-voice curator (smart sliding window)
Treating the window as a curated cache with identity as permanent Mercury is the right long-term framing. It doesn’t need to block v1, but it should shape what metadata you keep on thoughts and edges now (recency, access_freq, pin flags).
What needs sharpening before you build more
Minimal, concrete schema (first pass)
Keep it small to start; you can add fields later.
thought
id (uuid)
content (string)
mode (enum: conversation | planning | building | debugging | panic)
submode (string, optional)
created_at (timestamp)
embedding ([f32], optional in early in-memory paths)
significance (f32, 0..1; default 0.5)
access_count (u64, default 0)
last_accessed_at (timestamp, nullable)
outcome_score (f32, default 0.0) // future: consequences
tags (array)
relationship
id
from_thought -> to_thought
type (enum: FOLLOWS | RECALLS | REFERENCES | ASSOCIATES | CONTRADICTS | REINFORCES | SOLVES | DEPENDS_ON)
weight (f32)
created_at
mode (enum, optional) // the mode that formed this edge
Keep RECALLS and FOLLOWS only for v1 to avoid edge explosion.
A concrete scoring function (start simple, tune later)
Define a single scalar score used to rank candidates for injection.
Example (cosine similarity assumed): score = w_sim(sim) + w_recencyrecency_decay + w_significancesig + w_accessaccess_boost - w_contradictioncontradiction_penalty
sim: cosine(query_emb, memory_emb)
recency_decay = exp(-Δt / τ) // τ tuned per mode
sig: stored significance (0..1)
access_boost = log(1 + access_count)
contradiction_penalty: only if you’ve tagged contradictions (can be 0 initially)
Mode presets set w_* and τ. Example defaults:
Conversation: w_sim=0.55, w_recency=0.25, w_significance=0.15, w_access=0.05, τ=3 days
Planning: w_sim=0.45, w_recency=0.10, w_significance=0.35, w_access=0.10, τ=14 days
Building: w_sim=0.50, w_recency=0.05, w_significance=0.35, w_access=0.10, τ=21 days
Debugging: w_sim=0.60, w_recency=0.10, w_significance=0.20, w_access=0.10, τ=30 days
Panic: fast-path playbooks first, else Debugging params but k small
Map the orbital scale to concrete retrieval knobs
A table you can bake into code:
0: k=0, threshold=1.0 (no retrieval)
1: k=1–2, threshold=0.80, restrict to last 24h window
2: k=3–5, threshold=0.75, time window 7 days
3: k=5–8, threshold=0.70, time window 30 days
4: k=8–12, threshold=0.65, no time window, include ASSOCIATES if needed
5: k=12–20, threshold=0.60, allow lateral hops (ASSOCIATES, REFERENCES)
Implement as a function that returns params given scale + mode.
Control edge explosion
Cap RECALLS edges per thought per scale (e.g., max 8)
Decay or prune low-weight edges over time; periodically drop edges with weight < ε and no accesses in N days.
When adding a new RECALLS, if the cap is reached, replace the lowest-weight edge (reservoir sampling flavor) rather than blindly appending.
Protocol consistency
Your rmcp-based servers use ToolInputSchema { schema_type: "object" } while working_mcp uses inputSchema.type. Align on the MCP wire schema (type) and adapt in Rust with serde rename or rmcp’s types. This avoids client-side confusion.
Standardize error envelopes as application/json with a stable shape { error: { code, message } } even if rmcp doesn’t require it.
Operational posture early
Backups and export: Add an export endpoint or job to dump thoughts + relationships + embedding metadata periodically.
Observability: add tracing spans with request_id, mode, scale, vector_search_ms, injected_count.
Config: Feature-gate vector search to swap providers; parametrize k, thresholds, weights per mode via config file/env.
Is SurrealDB the right fit?
Short answer: Yes for the graph-first worldview; just hedge the vector-search bet.

Pros

Unified data model: graph edges, documents, and SQL-like querying in one place.
Relationship-first thinking: RELATE semantics are clean for your domain.
Developer ergonomics: One tool instead of juggling Postgres + Neo4j + vector DB.
Risks / mitigations

Vector search maturity: If SurrealDB’s HNSW/vector indexes are still evolving or less performant, you’ll feel it. Mitigation: abstract a VectorIndex trait and allow Qdrant/Weaviate as a drop-in backend. Keep SurrealDB as source of truth for thoughts/edges.
Query performance at scale: Graph traversals can get expensive. Mitigation: denormalize some precomputed paths for popular queries; keep a cap on per-thought edges; memoize “playbooks” for Panic/Debugging.
Ops maturity: Ensure TLS, auth, backups, resource limits, and clear migration story. Mitigation: start with kv-mem for dev, but lock in a docker-compose for a persistent backend early.
Pragmatic hybrid (recommended design guardrail)

Store thoughts and relationships in SurrealDB.
Provide a feature-flagged vector backend:
Backend::SurrealVectors (use if good enough)
Backend::Qdrant (99% works great, easy to run locally)
Keep the same embedding metadata and IDs so you can rebuild vectors or swap backends without touching the graph.
Local embeddings to avoid lock-in
Recommended starter set (all available via fastembed or sentence-transformers; all local):

Default: BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5 (384d). Great speed/quality trade-off, small memory.
Quality bump: BAAI/bge-base-en-v1.5 (768d). Slower, more accurate. If your machine can handle it and latency isn’t tight, this is my pick.
Multilingual: Alibaba-NLP/gte-multilingual-base or intfloat/multilingual-e5-small.
Very fast baseline: sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (384d). Acceptable for conversational memories.
Implementation advice

Normalize embeddings (L2) and use cosine similarity. Store a flag embedding_norm: bool in metadata to avoid future headaches.
Persist on each vector: { model_name, model_version, dim, tokenizer, created_at }.
Add an EmbeddingProvider abstraction with one method: embed(text) -> Vec. Back it with fastembed now; you can add an ONNXRuntime or GGUF pipeline later without touching the rest of the system.
Add a background “re-embed” job that can:
select WHERE embedding.model != current_model
re-embed in batches
write new vectors side-by-side, then flip an index alias
keep both temporarily to allow rollback
Concrete retrieval spec you can implement tomorrow
Preprocess
Lowercase, strip control chars, normalize whitespace, strip code fences unless in technical mode.
Embed
embed(processed_content). If empty after preprocessing, short-circuit.
Candidate search
Vector k from scale; threshold from mode/scale.
Hybrid: union with top-M BM25/keyword hits (M=3..5) when scale ≥ 3.
Score and filter
Apply the scoring function above; enforce cap per thought; drop below threshold.
Persist
CREATE thought
RELATE thought-[:RECALLS]->memory for accepted candidates with weight=score.
RELATE prev_thought-[:FOLLOWS]->thought if in same session/chain.
Update access_count/last_accessed_at on injected memories.
Response
enriched_content = original + bullet list of top 3 memory summaries (title/snippet)
memory_summary = “Injected N memories from orbit X (avg distance D)”
“Adderall” and Panic
Adderall:
injection_scale=0 (k=0), enriched_content = original.
Optionally allow 1 ultra-recent memory (last 5 minutes) if submode=building and user opts in.
Panic:
Precompute “playbooks” (SOLVES edges) from prior debugging outcomes; maintain a top-50 list per repo/project.
At call time: fetch 3 playbooks by error signature before any vector search; only if none match, fall back to vector.
Protocol and tooling alignment
MCP schema: Align to inputSchema.type on the wire; in Rust, if rmcp insists on schema_type, add serde(rename = "type").
Error shape: always JSON, consistent keys, and set is_error true.
Add integration tests that spin the in-memory server and validate:
tools/list returns convo_think with input schema
tools/call with empty content → error JSON, is_error=true
tools/call with scale=0 → no injections
Observability and guardrails
Tracing spans: initialize → list_tools → call_tool → vector_search → inject → persist.
Metrics: vector_latency_ms, injected_count, edge_count, graph_size, memory_prune_count, errors_by_mode.
Safety caps: max_thought_length, max_memories_per_injection, max_edges_per_thought, total_graph_size_limit with soft warning.
Suggested 2-week roadmap
Day 1–3

Lock minimal schema. Implement VectorIndex trait (SurrealVectors, Qdrant optional).
Implement convo_think end-to-end with the simple scoring function and scale table.
Standardize MCP schemas and error envelopes.
Day 4–6

Add think_technical with submodes (planning, building, debugging, panic) and preset weights.
Add FOLLOWS edges; cap edges; unit + integration tests for routing and injection.
Day 7–10

Benchmark BGE-small vs BGE-base on your target hardware. Capture p50/p95 latency; choose default.
Add hybrid search (BM25 or simple keyword) for scales ≥ 3.
Add metrics and tracing; add export job for backups.
Day 11–14

Introduce outcomes on thoughts and SOLVES edges; wire “Panic” to playbooks first.
Add a background task to decay weights and prune edges.
Final, blunt takes
You’re architecturally on the money. Most papers are just fancy window packing; you’re building persistent cognition.
Don’t overbuild the relationship set at v1; it will slow you down and create edge noise. Ship with RECALLS and FOLLOWS. Add SOLVES for Panic once you have outcomes.
Keep SurrealDB as the graph nucleus, but don’t be a hero on vector search—abstract it. If Surreal’s vector index flies: great. If it hiccups under load: flip to Qdrant and keep moving.
Local embeddings from day one are the right call. Store model metadata with every vector so you can migrate safely. Benchmark before you pick base vs small.
The “inner voice curator” is a future win; start collecting the signals now (access_count, last_accessed_at, pin flags) so it has data to learn from later.
If you want, I can turn the scoring function + scale table into Rust enums/config structs and sketch the SurrealDB queries you’d use for v1.
