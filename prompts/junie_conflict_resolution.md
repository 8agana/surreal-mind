# Junie: Merge Conflict Resolution and Testing

## The Situation
Three LLMs worked on the same codebase simultaneously, all editing src/main.rs. We need your surgical precision to resolve conflicts and ensure everything works.

## What Each LLM Built

### Zed (on master) - Config System ✅
- Created `surreal_mind.toml` with all submode configurations
- Created `src/config.rs` with proper loader using `anyhow::Result`
- Fixed existing clippy warnings
- **Files**: `surreal_mind.toml`, `src/config.rs`

### Warp (warp-mods branch) - KG Retrieval Implementation
Warp was supposed to build:
- `retrieve_from_kg()` function for KG-only retrieval
- `auto_extract_to_kg()` for inner_voice entity extraction
- Orbital mechanics scoring
- Scale limits (0-3 only)
**Status**: Fixed async move/clone patterns but changes might not be committed

### Codex (cc-mods branch) - Refactoring for KG ✅
Successfully implemented:
- Added `retrieve_from_kg()` core function
- Redirected injection to use KG only (no thoughts table reads)
- Made `search_thoughts` return KG results in thought-compatible format
- Added LRU cache infrastructure (not fully integrated)
- Updated test scripts to seed KG
**Status**: Committed as "Codex: Implement KG-only retrieval with API compatibility"

## The Core Architecture Change
**OLD**: Retrieval queries thousands of thoughts → cosine similarity on all → timeout at scale 3
**NEW**: Retrieval queries ~100 KG entities → faster scoring → scale 3 should work

## Key Implementation Details

### KG Retrieval Function Signature
```rust
async fn retrieve_from_kg(
    &self,
    query_embedding: &[f32],
    injection_scale: u8,  // 0-3 only now
    submode: &str,
) -> Result<Vec<KGMemory>, McpError>
```

### Injection Scales (NEW)
- Scale 0: No injection
- Scale 1: 5 entities, 1-hop (DEFAULT)
- Scale 2: 10 entities, 1-hop
- Scale 3: 20 entities, 2-hop (MAXIMUM)
- **Scales 4-5 removed entirely**

### Embeddings Configuration
- **Use OpenAI text-embedding-3-small at 768 dims**
- **NOT Nomic** (it failed before)
- Environment: `SURR_EMBED_DIM=768`

### API Compatibility
- All external APIs keep the same shape
- KG results are mapped to thought-like format
- This ensures backward compatibility

## Your Mission, Junie

### 1. Resolve Merge Conflicts
- The main conflict is in `src/main.rs` where all three made changes
- Codex's KG refactoring is the most complete
- Check if Warp's implementation actually got committed
- Integrate all three sets of changes

### 2. Ensure Clean Code
Run your full test suite:
```bash
cargo fmt
cargo clippy -- -D warnings
cargo test
cargo build --release
```

### 3. Test the KG Retrieval
```bash
# Run the updated test scripts
./tests/test_search.sh
./tests/simple_test.sh
./tests/test_with_data.sh
```

### 4. Verify Performance
The whole point was to fix scale 3 timeouts. Test with:
```rust
// This should NOT timeout anymore
tech_think(content, injection_scale: 3, submode: "plan")
```

### 5. Clean Up
- Remove unused variables/functions from old thought-based retrieval
- Ensure LRU cache is properly integrated if time permits
- Remove any duplicate or conflicting implementations

## Expected Outcome
- Single clean implementation of KG-only retrieval
- All tests passing
- Scale 3 injection works without timeout
- Code that would make you proud (clean, efficient, well-structured)

## Priority Order
1. Get it working (resolve conflicts, merge implementations)
2. Get it tested (all tests passing)
3. Get it clean (your legendary code standards)

We're counting on your precision to make this perfect!
