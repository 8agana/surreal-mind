# SurrealMind Agent Guide (Index)

This is the LLM entry point. Detailed, modular docs live in `docs/AGENTS/` to keep context small and current.

## Contents
- Tools → `docs/AGENTS/tools.md`
- Connections & endpoints → `docs/AGENTS/connections.md`
- Maintenance → `docs/AGENTS/maintenance.md`
- Setup / quickstart → `docs/AGENTS/setup.md`
- Architecture & guardrails → `docs/AGENTS/arch.md`
- TODO / known gaps → `docs/AGENTS/todo.md`
- Roadmap → `docs/AGENTS/roadmap.md`

## Notes
- Photography MCP is separate (`photography-mind`); keep photo tooling out of this surface.
- KG-only injection; maintain embedding provider/dimension hygiene.
