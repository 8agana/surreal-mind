## Last Nightly Run — 2026-02-17 ~07:00 UTC

All 5 tasks completed successfully. Total runtime: ~7.9 minutes.

| Task | Status | Duration | Notes |
|------|--------|----------|-------|
| `populate` | OK | 37s | 3 thoughts → 6 entities, 5 obs, 7 edges created |
| `embed` | OK | 20s | 100% coverage, 18 records embedded |
| `rethink` | OK | <1s | 4 correction events created |
| `wander` | OK | ~7 min | 50 steps, Gemini CLI cluster |
| `health` | OK | <1s | No decay, no orphans |

Embedding health at completion: **12,339 records, 100% coverage**.

## Finding 1: Wander Entity Explosion

During last night's discretionary phase, `kg_wander` got trapped in a loop around the Gemini CLI implementation review cluster. Starting from a Gemini timeout investigation node, it identified architectural gaps and responded by creating entities — repeatedly — for the same concepts:

- **"Gemini CLI JSON Extraction Strategy"** — created ~10+ times as `technical_specification`, `technical_requirement`, etc.
- **"Gemini CLI Error Resilience Framework/Protocol/Strategy"** — created ~8+ times with minor name variants
- **"CognitiveAgent Trait"** — created at least twice
- **"Gemini CLI Resiliency Framework"** — created 3+ times

Steps 4–25 of the 50-step wander were almost entirely `CREATE_ENTITY` on the same conceptual territory. The wander only broke out at step 26 when it found a different cluster.

**Net result:** The nightly maintenance run that's supposed to improve KG quality actively made fragmentation worse. The Gemini CLI entity cluster is now significantly bloated with near-duplicate nodes.

---

## Finding 2: Deduplication Pipeline Has No Executor

The correction pipeline has a detection-logging gap with no execution step:

```
wander → identifies duplicates → rethink(mark)
gem_rethink → creates CorrectionEvents → STOPS
```

CorrectionEvents in the database have `new_state: {}` — empty. There is no tool or task that reads these events and performs the actual merge/delete. The 4 Scalpel/Task-5 duplicates flagged last night still exist as entities. Every correction event is intent with no follow-through.

**Current correction queue (as of 2026-02-17):**

| Target | Reasoning | Status |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| `5k6uo2einulvh4n5d3cg` | Duplicate of Scalpel (Haiku) `w12ealulwzxeqbkitby1` | Unresolved |
| `tqwqszp5bfror3ciiwgi` | Duplicate of Scalpel (Haiku) `w12ealulwzxeqbkitby1` | Unresolved |
| `nbo6a4tj80e2kblv7wbk` | Duplicate of Scalpel (Haiku) `w12ealulwzxeqbkitby1` | Unresolved |
| `dfsx9ouvi8pog6jqu8ul` | Duplicate of Task-5 project entity | Unresolved |

Plus an unknown number of new Gemini CLI entity duplicates created last night, not yet flagged.

## Summary

REMini's nightly cycle is functioning mechanically (all 5 tasks run, embeddings healthy) but has two systemic quality problems:

1. **Wander creates more fragmentation than it resolves** when it gets stuck in a cluster. It has no loop-detection or entity-creation throttle.

2. **The correction pipeline is a graveyard.** Detection works. Logging works. Execution doesn't exist. Duplicates accumulate indefinitely.

---

## Recommended Fixes

### Short-term
- Manual deduplication pass on the Gemini CLI cluster (CC or Gem can do this in a focused session)
- Manual delete/merge the 4 known Scalpel/Task-5 duplicates

### Architectural
- **Wander:** Add entity-creation throttle (e.g., max N `CREATE_ENTITY` actions per wander run, or per-cluster cap) and visited-cluster tracking to prevent looping
- **Correction pipeline:** Build a `kg_deduplicate` executor task — reads `CorrectionEvents` where `new_state` is empty and `reasoning` contains a merge target, performs the actual delete/re-edge operation, updates the event with `new_state` confirming resolution
