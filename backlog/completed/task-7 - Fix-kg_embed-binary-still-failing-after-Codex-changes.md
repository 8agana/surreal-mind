## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
kg_embed is still broken despite Codex's attempted fix. Need to investigate what's failing and actually resolve it.

Binary location: ~/Projects/LegacyMind/surreal-mind/target/release/kg_embed
Source: ~/Projects/LegacyMind/surreal-mind/src/bin/kg_embed.rs

Check Codex's recent commits to see what was changed and why it's still not working.
<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:END -->

## Complete. See Changelog.
