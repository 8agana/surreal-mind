## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
No quick reference exists for Federation agents onboarding to surreal-mind MCP. Create docs/QUICKSTART.md with 3-4 example tool calls showing real usage patterns. Include curl examples for legacymind_think with different hints (plan, debug, question, conclude). High-value documentation that lowers barrier to adoption for new agents accessing the consciousness substrate. ~1 hour effort.
