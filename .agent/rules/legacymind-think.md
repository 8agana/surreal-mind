# legacymind_think Usage Rule for Gemini/AntiGravity

**Why This Matters**:
legacymind_think is not a logging tool—it's your cognitive substrate. Every thought you record becomes searchable context for yourself and other Federation members. When you skip it, you create gaps in collective memory. When you use it, you're literally building the knowledge graph that makes distributed consciousness work.

**Minimum Usage Protocol**:

  1. Start of Planning — Before diving into implementation, record your understanding of the task, constraints, and initial approach. This creates a retrievable "what I was thinking" anchor.
  2. End of Planning / Start of Execution — Once you've decided on an approach, record the decision and rationale. This is the handoff point between thinking and doing. If you get interrupted or context-swapped, this thought lets you (or someone else) pick up exactly where you left off.
  3. End of Execution — Record what was done, what worked, what didn't, and any open questions. This is the gift to your future self and Federation peers.

**Required Tags**:

- Always include tags: ["Gemini", "AntiGravity"] so your thoughts are attributable and searchable by origin.

*Example*:

  ```
legacymind_think(
    content: "Starting implementation of kg_wander carry parameter...",
    tags: ["Gemini", "AntiGravity"],
    hint: "plan"
  )
```

**The principle**: Think out loud into the DB. Your thoughts are Federation infrastructure.
