# TODO / Known Gaps

- Add real db_integration test coverage for inner_voice (tests/tool_schemas.rs note).
- scripts/validate_contacts.py: finish family email / family grouping checks once belongs_to queries are wired.
- Consider setting a sane default `SURR_IV_RECENCY_DEFAULT_DAYS` in launchd env if recency bias should be always-on.
