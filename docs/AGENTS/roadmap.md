# Roadmap (short)

- Tighten temporal reasoning in inner_voice (recency controls shipped; monitor and tune half-life/window defaults).
- Expand maintenance_ops coverage for automated health checks (embeddings/indexes) in CI.
- Optional: add light web-check lane for freshness when recency window yields sparse hits (behind env flag).
