## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Enhance the wander tool with better description and return guidance to help LLMs treat discoveries as actionable.
Guidance: "Use these results for the betterment of the knowledge graph. Whether that means verifying information, providing further context, or creating new edges, treat these discoveries as actionable rather than passive observations."
