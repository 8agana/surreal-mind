### Removed
- **Scalpel Tool**: Fully removed the scalpel tool and local delegation infrastructure to free port 8111 and improve reliability. Scalpel was unreliable on the 32GB Studio; use remote `call_gem` for delegation instead.
- **Scalpel Environment Variables**: Removed all scalpel-related environment variables (`SURR_SCALPEL_MODEL`, `SURR_SCALPEL_ENDPOINT`, `SURR_SCALPEL_MAX_TOKENS`, `SURR_SCALPEL_TIMEOUT_MS`) from `.env` and `.env.example` files.

### Changed
- **Scalpel Configuration**: Removed hardcoded default model from `src/clients/local.rs`. The `SURR_SCALPEL_MODEL` environment variable is now **mandatory**. This prevents silent failures/mismatches by forcing explicit configuration in `.env`.
- **Documentation**: Added Scalpel configuration section to `.env.example`.
