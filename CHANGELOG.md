## 2025-09-07 - Major Refactor: Unified Thinking Tools (Phases A/B/C)

### Phase A - Router Pattern (8 minutes implementation by Grok)
- **Consolidated 5 tools → 2 domain tools**: `legacymind_think` and `photography_think`
- **Automatic mode routing** via trigger phrases or heuristic keywords
  - Trigger phrases: "debug time", "building time", "plan time", "i'm stuck", "question time"
  - Heuristic fallback: error→debug, implement→build, design→plan
- **Extracted common logic** to `src/tools/thinking.rs` with `run_*` functions
- **Backward compatible**: Legacy tools still available, internally route through new system

### Phase B - Session Continuity (6.5 minutes implementation by Grok)
- **Added session linking fields**: `session_id`, `previous_thought_id`, `chain_id`
- **Thought chaining**: Create linked sequences of thoughts across sessions
- **Revision tracking**: `revises_thought`, `branch_from` for non-linear thinking
- **Telemetry**: Track what triggered routing decisions

### Phase C - Hypothesis Verification (Completed by Grok)
- **Evidence-based validation**: Query KG for supporting/contradicting evidence
- **Deterministic classification**: Pattern matching for contradiction detection
- **Confidence scoring**: `supporting_count / (supporting_count + contradicting_count)`
- **Configurable thresholds**: Via env vars `SURR_VERIFY_TOPK`, `SURR_VERIFY_MIN_SIM`
- **Optional persistence**: Store verification results as JSON blob on thought

### Implementation Stats
- **Total time**: 14.5 minutes (Phase A: 8 min, Phase B: 6.5 min)
- **Tests**: All 41 passing, zero clippy warnings
- **Team**: Codex (design), Grok Code Fast 1 (implementation), CC (testing/feedback)

## 2025-08-27 14:54 CDT

### Added
- **Retry Logic for Database Operations**: Added robust retry mechanism with exponential backoff for all critical database operations:
  - `with_retry()` utility function with configurable retry counts and delays
  - Environment variables for configuration:
    - `SURR_MAX_RETRIES` (default: 3)
    - `SURR_RETRY_DELAY_MS` (default: 500ms)
  - Smart error classification to avoid retrying logic errors (parse, syntax, invalid, permission)

## 2025-08-24 22:19 UTC

### Added
- Default SurrealDB service (WebSocket) configuration via environment variables:
  - SURR_DB_URL (default 127.0.0.1:8000)
  - SURR_DB_USER (default root)
  - SURR_DB_PASS (default root)
  - SURR_DB_NS (default surreal_mind)

- Nomic embeddings HTTP client timeout (15s) for more robust external calls.

### Changed
- Retrieval pipeline now increments access_count and updates last_accessed when DB-backed memories are selected.
- Relationship creation is now bidirectional: creates both from->recalls->to and to->recalls->from.
- Memory summary now reports explicit min/max orbital proximity values rather than relying on sorted order.
- Cosine similarity calculation now computes dot and norms over the same span to avoid skew with unequal vector lengths.
- .env.example updated with SurrealDB service config and test control variable.

  - initial formatting/clippy/test compile cleanups
- aeba2f2 feat(db): default to SurrealDB service (Ws) with env config
